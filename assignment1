#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the process of designing, developing, and maintaining software.

Importance are:  it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
                  it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance.
                  it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance
                  it implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering machine
Mastering process
Mastering complexity

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1) Planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
2) Requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
3) Design - building the framework. 
4) Coding - converting software design into tangible code.
 5) Testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach to software development. It follows a rigid, step-by-step process where each phase must be completed before the next one begins. There is no overlap between phases, and it's difficult to go back to a previous stage once completed. It is appropriate in:Large projects with fixed requirements: Waterfall works best when the project scope, technology, and requirements are well-understood from the beginning.
                                                         Highly regulated industries: For example, government, healthcare, or aerospace, where documentation and clear phases are essential.
                                                         Maintenance projects: When working on software that doesn't require frequent updates or iterative changes, Waterfall can be efficient.

Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. It focuses on delivering smaller, functional parts of the software quickly and iterating based on continuous feedback from stakeholders and end-users. Agile embraces change and is flexible throughout the development process.
it is appropriate in: Dynamic, Evolving Projects: Projects where requirements are unclear or expected to change based on user feedback, such as software applications, mobile apps, or websites.
                      Quick Delivery: When you need to deliver working software in small iterations for continuous evaluation, such as in startups or MVP development.
                      Collaboration-driven Projects: Projects where communication and flexibility are crucial to success, such as in digital marketing or product design.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of IDES :Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
                  An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax                     errors.
                  An IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
Importance of VCS: Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
                                   Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
                                   Used for error Recovery where it allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats

Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
 
 Rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
 
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing input queries to optimize AI responses, ensuring accuracy, relevance, and clarity.
Importance:
Optimizing Efficiency: Properly engineered prompts lead to faster, more accurate outputs, reducing the need for extensive post-processing or clarification.
Improving AI-User Interaction: It allows users to engage more effectively with AI, making the AI more useful in practical scenarios like writing, problem-solving, coding, or data analysis.
Maximizing AI Potential: By understanding and leveraging the strengths of the model, prompt engineering helps unlock the full potential of AI systems.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about climate change."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain the main causes of climate change, including both natural and human factors, and provide examples for each."

Explanation of Improvement:
Clarity: The vague prompt asks broadly about "climate change," which can lead to a wide range of responses. The improved prompt specifies what exactly should be discussed: "the main causes of climate change."

Specificity: The improved prompt specifies that both "natural and human factors" should be included, making it clear that the response should address both categories of causes.

Conciseness: The improved prompt is still short but provides clear direction, making it concise while narrowing down the scope to the most relevant information.
